# Alena's Kaggle Utilities

This is a collection of scripts to work quickly on Kaggle data and other datasets. This project is a work-in-progress, inspired by [Jeff Heaton's Kaggle Utilities](https://github.com/jeffheaton/jh-kaggle-util).

The pipeline I'm building is in flux, feel free to [check out the vision](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10uiFtBN88dt-0jrgajvC5uNgvxGNic8N/view?usp=sharing).
